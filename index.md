Hi! I am Terezia Slaninakova, a Ph.D. candidate (finishing in Q1-Q2 of 2026) and a researcher at Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. 

I am focused on creating useful end-to-end applications for processing of complex data.

I got my B.S.c-equivalent in Computer Science in Brno University of Technology in 2018, in my final thesis I focused on [generative AI applied to sound](https://www.vut.cz/www_base/zav_prace_soubor_verejne.php?file_id=181308) in [Speech@FIT lab](https://speech.fit.vut.cz). While studying I also worked at [Y Soft](https://ysoft.com) and [Adacta](https://adactainsurance.com).

For my M.S.c, I studied Artificial intelligence and Data processing, while working on applied ML projects at [CERIT-SC](https://www.cerit-sc.cz/), including life tissue and remote sensing data. For my thesis, I [created an ML-based index high-dimensional vector data](https://is.muni.cz/th/f274m/).

I began my Ph.D. in Spring 2021, focused on extending my work on the ML-based vector index under the [GF23-07040K](https://starfos.tacr.cz/en/projekty/GF23-07040K#project-main) project shared with Kroger's lab at CAU in Kiel, Germany. The theoretical work ultimately lead to creating an application for finding proteins with similar structure, [AlphaFind](https://alphafind.fi.muni.cz/), used by biologists around the world. Recently, we extended on the basic functionality with [AlphaFind v2](https://alphafind.ics.muni.cz/). While on Ph.D., I attended three internships - in [Daisy lab](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/) under prof. Jensen in Aalborg, Denmark, in [Database Sysems and Data Mining group](https://www.uni-kiel.de/de/tf/forschen/institut-informatik/datenbanksysteme-und-data-mining) under prof. Kröger in CAU, Kiel, Germany, and, most recently, in [Greener group](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/greener/members/) at MRC-LMB in Cambridge, UK.

I am currently working on a similarity search system for molecular dynamics simulations and using AI to perfect search in czech research data within [eosc-cz](https://www.eosc.cz/) project. I am also looking for cool opportunities and projects to get into after my Ph.D.
